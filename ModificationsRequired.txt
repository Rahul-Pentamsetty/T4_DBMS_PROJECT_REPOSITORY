3.	Retrieve Company details whose number of products is greater than departments,

* department_location_count() returns UNIQUE addresses for the given office of a company

Things to do: Increase product count such that prod_count() > dept_count()
AND add office places to have more than one CITY

SELECT product_count(Company_name),department_count(Company_name),department_location_count(Company_name)
FROM T4_Insurance_Company;
